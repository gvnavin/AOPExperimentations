Please follow the below link to setup aspectj in intellij
http://tzachsolomon.blogspot.com/2015/08/how-to-create-hello-world-with-intellij.html

This project is just to show how to measure the execution time without touching existing code using aspectj.
Here the aspect is created using aspect code, not using annotations

In Intellij, need to do Build -> Rebuild Project, then Run.
Without rebuilding the latest aspect changes are refelcted.

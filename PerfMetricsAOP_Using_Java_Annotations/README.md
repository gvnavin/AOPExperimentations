http://tzachsolomon.blogspot.com/2015/08/how-to-create-hello-world-with-intellij.html

This project is just to show how to measure the execution time without touching existing code using aspectj.

In Intellij, need to do Build -> Rebuild Project, then Run.
Without rebuilding the latest aspect changes are refelcted.
